## About

I obtained my college degree as a State Teacher of Philosophy (USACH), and now I'm a PhD student in Education @ PUC Chile. I'm interested in researching the affects produced by datafication technologies and big data in higher education and Academia from a cyberfeminist and posthumanist perspective.
