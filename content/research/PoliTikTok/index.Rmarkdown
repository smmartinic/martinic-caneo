Politiktok is an interdisciplinary research team from the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile, funded by the National Agency for Research and Development (ANID). We focus on analyzing how young Chileans use TikTok as a platform to express their opinions on social justice, politics, and current issues. We also focus on the affective economy of affordances and the algorithmic governance of the platform. I am a research assistant on this project.
